Feature Selection 
=================

Data Background:
-----------------
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

Raw Data Structure:
--------------------
The data is split into 'Train' and 'Test' groups. For each group, the data is organised into the following files.

x - The actual data set containing the signal related data.These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

y- The file contains the activity id for each observation.
subject - The file contains the subject id for each observation.
Inertial signals - These data are not needed for the analysis.
activity-labels - This contains the 'Activity name' for each activity id.

Processed Data:
---------------

The processed data contains the 'mean' of the STD and Mean measures from the original data set grouped by the Subject id and Activity Name. The dataset is obtained by performing the below steps on the raw data set.

1. Combine the Train and Test datasets for X, y and subject into a sigle set of X,y and subject data sets. Apply the column names to X,y and subject data here.After this step each data set has 10299 rows. Further X has 561 columns.
2. Merge the X,y and subject datasets obtained in previous step into a single super dataset cointaining all details.The resulting dataset has 10299 rows and 563 columns.
3. From the merged data set filter only the columns containing 'mean' or 'std' to create a narrow dataset (MeanFreq is not considered).The resulting data set has 69 columns and 10299 rows.
4. Apply the Activity names in place of the activity id in the narrow data set to make it more readable.
5. Summarize the dataset obtained in previous step to compute the mean of the columns for each Subecjid and Activity name. The resulting data contains 180 rows and 69 columns.
